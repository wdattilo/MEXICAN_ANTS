# MEXICAN_ANTS
Our aims in this data paper are to: (i) compile all the information available regarding ants across the Mexican territory and (ii) identify major patterns in the gathered dataset and geographic gaps to direct future sampling efforts. All records were obtained from raw data including both unpublished and published information. After an exhaustive filtering and update of information and synonyms, we compiled a total of 21,731 records for 887 ant species distributed throughout Mexico from 1894 to 2018. These records were concentrated mainly in the states of Chiapas (n= 6,902, 32.76%) and Veracruz de Ignacio de la Llave (n= 4,329, 19.92%), which together hold half of the records. The subfamily with the highest number of records was Myrmicinae (n=10,458 records, 48.12%), followed by Formicinae (n= 3,284, 15.11%) and Ponerinae (n= 1,914, 8.8%). Most ant records were collected in the Neotropical region of the country (n= 12,646, 58.19%), followed by the Mexican transition zone (n= 5,237, 24.09%) and the Nearctic region (n= 3,848, 17.72%). Surprisingly, native species corresponded to 95.46% of the records (n= 20,745). To the best of our knowledge this is the most complete data set available to date in the literature for the country. We hope that this compilation will encourage researchers to explore different aspects of population and community research of ants at different spatial scales, and to aid in the establishment of conservation policies and actions.
